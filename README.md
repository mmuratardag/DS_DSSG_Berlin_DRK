# Data Science for Social Good Berlin
## Datathon 2021
### the German Red Cross

I participated in the Data Science for Social Good Berlin Datathon 2021, an one-and-a-half-day online event organized by almost a dozen [core-team-members](https://dssg-berlin.org/en/). There were dozens of fellow volunteers who contributed to multiple project during the occasion.

I conducted exploratory data analysis for the German Red Cross by 
* examining the Google Analytics data of their job portal.
* fitting structural topic models on the job descriptions to see which topic proportions are related to unique page views.
